# Graph

# vertex -> node in a graph
# edge -> connects two vertices
# weight -> cost of going from one vertex to another
# path -> sequence of vertices connected by edges
# cycle -> a path that starts and ends in the same vertex

# TODO
# - addVertex(vert) -> adds new vertex to graph
# - addEdge(fromVert, toVert) -> adds directed edge
# - addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) -> adds weighted directed edge
# - getVertex(vertKey) -> finds vertex with key name
# - getVertices() -> get list of vertices in graph
# - in -> boolean to check if vertex is in graph
